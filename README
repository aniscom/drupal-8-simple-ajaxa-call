##This plugin is for Drupal 8.x 
The plugin is a infinite ajax scroll of Articles


For this i created a simple module : ajaxpagination (check drupal/modules/ajaxpagination/)

On ajaxpagination.routing.yml i add 2 links '/ajaxcall/{id}' where i will made ajax call by jQuery and it will return me the next Article

the second one is 'http://website.com/blogajax' this link will show the last added article

well you can change it and use the plugin for example make it simple http://website.com/blog/ 

when you made the changes in ajaxpagination.routing.yml don't forget to clean the cache, from admin panel of drupal http://your-website.com/admin/config/development/performance
